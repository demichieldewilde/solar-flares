# Progress overview



## SST flares to be processed 

### To Download




5) 

6)  https://dubshen.astro.su.se/sst_archive/observations/571 Secret SST m-flare whic we need permission for, but its super pretty and near the disk center. 


### To Do FOV Calculation

### To Do Voight Fitting


### To Do Full analysis plot





### To Do paper filling in

1)2021-05-26 https://dubshen.astro.su.se/sst_archive/observations/281 (small C flare near the disk center)

2) 2023-06-18 https://dubshen.astro.su.se/sst_archive/observations/397
https://dubshen.astro.su.se/sst_archive/observations/398
(Small B flare but very pretty!) This is the other flare that Julius gave us.


3) 2016-05-14 the older flare that Julius gave us, i think that I sent it to you a while ago but I don't see it in the list. It is on the cloud as a fits, maybe you just didn't upload it? 

    -> Ha: give positino
    -> CaIR: Give position


4) 2022-05-20 https://dubshen.astro.su.se/sst_archive/observations/372 (Mflare near disk center, useful for our spread!) It's open source, but belongs to Lucia so would need new authors. I don't mind but Carsten does not like her. 

7) 2015-05-05 is on the cloud, the other 2 i have to download and add (Tine's flare in He (jn cloud) its just 15 frames but its a nice one. )
## To Do's (other)

Priority list
1. X1.5, C2.0 resize plots. Done for X1.5, not possible for
C2.0 as telescope moves a lot.
2. Malcolm and Alex to go through the flares: M1.9, M1.1,
(X1.5), C5.6, C4.1, X8.2, C1.3... then (X1.5 again), C2.0
3. Pulsation investigation: Why? X2.2: X1.5, M1.1 weird? C5.6
    (a) just point them out to the reader
    (b) time association with particular flare events/instrumental
    (c) speculation based on time associations (danger zone).
    (d) causation: difference image over FOV with a time delay
    equivalent to pulsation duration. Done for X2.2 flare
4. flows: shifts over time in the FOV
    – Point this out to the reader
    – time association of actions
    – - speculation based on time associations.
    – - causation: Not sure, ale suggests image.
5. M1.1 pick frame with more flare
6. other collorplot helium Done
7. DEW normalizeren.
8. Normalization fig. 2 is on the same time? check this
9. Full analysis plots: subTitles, shorter, only name of line
above collorplotn NESS(i)
10. Use Å in stead of Å
11.  Check X1.5 flare the limb is realy the limb of tthe mu lines,
Probably true
12. residues -¿ residuals
13. save as .pdf i.s.o. .png
14. collorbar?? see if more uniform with the scale but almost oke
15. CAII8542A beter in the plot!
