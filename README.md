This code is used for the data analysis of the paper "Integrated full disc Sun-as-a-star flare observations synthesised
from a small field of view" By Michiel De Wilde, Alexander G.M. Pietrow , Malcolm Keith Druett , and Adur Pastor Yabar

and badly written by Michiel ;)

Only the data is not included for memory and legal reasons. 
Some of data is free available for example for the flares 
    -2011-08-06
    -2014-09-06
    -2015-06-24

These thus can be repeated yourself. 
go to data to investigate. There the .ipynb files for each line describe the process. 
The 2014-09-06 and the 2015-06-24 are the best to have a look at. 

After the basic gauging to NESSI and calculating the FOV_spectrum_over_time all flares are 
voight fitted in the folder data/voight_fitting and thereafter plotted with their full 
analysis in data/full_analysis. 

data/optimal_with is a side project.
